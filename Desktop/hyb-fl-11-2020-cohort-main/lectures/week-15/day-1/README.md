# Week 15 - Day 1: Tuesday March 16, 2021

### Full-Stack Projects Work In-Class

## Agenda

- Open Floor
- Full-Stack Projects - Work In-Class:
- End of Day 1 ["Stand Up"](https://forms.gle/G6PoGLSpnFQhrzTR6)
- [Trello Project-Management Template](https://trello.com/templates/project-management/simple-project-board-6QW0Ciu8/vickibealman1/recommend)

## Required Day 1
Review the technical requirements, and focus on making commits on day 1 that only serve to check boxes on the requirements. Your initial git should include:

- base source files - ```index.html```, ```scripts``` folder, ```css``` folder, ```images``` folder
- choose a css library and get it installed (bulma/foundation/bootstrap)
- when you have found your APIs, add a couple of fetch requests to your main script that just perform the requests and store the response in a variable
- bring in a supporting javascript library and install it into your html
- slap HELLO WORLD into your ```index.html```
- add a ```README.md``` that gives an outline of your project

At this point, commit, and then focus on the rest of day 1 and 2 on deploying it. 
- As soon as you can see your "```HELLO WORLD```" page deployed, turn right back around and actually build the thing.

I can count on one hand the number of students who heed the "check the boxes, deploy early" advice, but I still stand by it. Knowing you've ticked the boxes and can focus on building something unique is a huge relief and frees you up for stretch goals without worrying about how you're going to deploy.
