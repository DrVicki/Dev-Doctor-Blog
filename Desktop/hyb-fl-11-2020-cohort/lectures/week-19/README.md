# Week 19

Welcome to Career Planning!!

Career Prep consists of two class days dedicated to preparing your career assets and training for the job search. During this time there will be no technical aspects of class as led by your instructor. Your Instructor will be available to help with technical aspects of creating and hosting your portfolio, and the Student Success team will be available for the rest. Students will prepare for the job search during Career Prep and throughout the program by:

- Creating an engaging online presence.
- Crafting a professional resume.
- Building a unique portfolio of projects.
- Participating in Algorithm Fridays to prepare for technical interviews.
- Completing a mock technical interview with a Senior SWE in the industry (in real time).

# Graduation Requirement!

The Student Success team is committed to helping each student build on their individuality, skills, and background to put their best foot forward in the job search. We strive to provide the adequate resources and career training to ensure that all students are equipped with the tools to be successful in the job search. 
- **For this reason we require the submission of a passing resume & portfolio. 
- **Successful completion of your resume and portfolio is a graduation requirement and approved in our state catalog.

## Workshops

During your time in Career Prep you will have the opportunity to participate in soft skill workshops focused on utilizing transferable skills to improve your resources. 
- Workshops will consist of live feedback on your resume and portfolio, interview training, networking, and job applications.
