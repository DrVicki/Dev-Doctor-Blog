## Notes from class
- The console issues crdeating errors appears to be from a "strict use" error.

## Browser console
- When you use a developer console to run code, please note that it doesn’t use strict by default.
- Sometimes, when use strict makes a difference, you’ll get incorrect results.

So, how to actually use strict in the console?
- First, you can try to press Shift+Enter to input multiple lines, and put use strict on top, like this:

'use strict'; <Shift+Enter for a newline>
//  ...your code
<Enter to run>

It works in most browsers, namely Firefox and Chrome.

## If it doesn’t, e.g. in an old browser, there’s an ugly, but reliable way to ensure use strict. Put it inside this kind of wrapper:

(function() {
  'use strict';

  // ...your code here...
})()
