# Week 17: Intro to React

React is a small but flexible front-end library that helps you create UIs. It is especially well-suited for UIs that need to display data that updates frequently. This week, you will learn the basics of building React applications, relying primarily on your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

You will start with simple functions that draw data to the page and build up your React knowledge. By the end of the module, you will be creating and (re)using highly-performant React components.
