# Week 21

## Welcome to: Building an Ecommerce site with React and Redux

This week, you will put your React and Redux skills to use on a fairly complex web application. In addition, you will integrate with the Stripe payment API. (Don't worry, you won't go broke building and debugging your app - you'll only work with a testing server.)

- Stripe API
- Authentication
